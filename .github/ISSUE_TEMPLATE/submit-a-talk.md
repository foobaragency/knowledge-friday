<!-- We've prepared a basic structure to support you creating a great submission. You'll find hints in comments like this and we hoe they're helpful. Using this approach is not mandatory, though.

## 🚡 Elevator Pitch

<!-- Sell your talk! Write a few exciting and enticing lines. Invite and intrigue, attract people and make them curious. But make it short! -->

## 📖 Description

<!-- This is the place for more details. What is your topic about? What does it include? What are the main focus points? Where does it originate from? What's the benefit or advantage? -->

## 📊 Metadata

<!-- Below you can add additional info, e.g. if audience need to bring something, a second speaker who will be joining you, things you need for the presentation, etc. -->

### 📺 Format and Duration

<!-- Formats: Presentation (maybe the most common one), live coding, live demo, panel discussion, mob programming, open discussion, or anything you can think of. -->

<!-- Duration: The calendar date is planned for 1 hour. It can be exceeded a bit, but consider attendees may have other plans afterwards. So it would be great if you try to fit your talk into 60 minutes. Also, consider 5-10 minutes at the end for a Q&A session. If you can't do your special wwithin that time frame, it's not a show-stopper! We'll figure something out. -->

<!-- Example: Presenation with live coding ca. 50 min + 10 min Q&A -->
