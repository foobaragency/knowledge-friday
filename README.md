# Knowledge Friday

Ideally once a week, we have a session for knowledge exchange. Everyone is welcome to propose a talk they'd give, something valuable they'd like to share, something they're kenn on.

To find out what topics are the most intriguing, we have an open, ongoing voting. The proposal with the most votes gets selected with priority, depending on the speaker(s) being ok with the date.

## Here's how it works!

### Got a topic you'd like to speak about?

Enter its title and your name into the voting table. Add an excerpt if you like. It doesn't need to be 60 minutes long, even lightning talks of 5-10 minutes are welcome and can be fit into a Knowledge Friday.

### Found a talk you'd enjoy?

Just put your name into the column "I'm intrigued!" for a proposal you like.
