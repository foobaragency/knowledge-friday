# Knowledge Friday

Ideally once a week, we have a session for knowledge exchange. Everyone is welcome to propose a talk they'd give, something valuable they'd like to share, something they're keen on.

To find out what topics are the most intriguing, we have an open, ongoing voting. The proposal with the most votes gets selected with priority, depending on the speaker(s) being ok with the date.

## Here's how it works!

### Got a topic you'd like to speak about?

[Create a new proposal](https://github.com/foobaragency/knowledge-friday/issues/new?template=talk-proposal.md&title=Topic). Add an excerpt if you like.

It doesn't need to be 60 minutes long, even lightning talks of 5-10 minutes are welcome and can be fit into a Knowledge Friday.

### Got a topic you'd like to learn about?

Create a new issue or use the [template](https://github.com/foobaragency/knowledge-friday/issues/new?template=talk-proposal.md&title=Topic) to suggest a topic that you would like to learn about.

### Voting on topics

You can find all open topics [here](https://github.com/foobaragency/knowledge-friday/issues) and if you're interested in past topics, you can find them [here](https://github.com/foobaragency/knowledge-friday/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

To vote, [add an emoji](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) (e.g. thumbs up) to the proposal. 

### Found a talk you'd enjoy?

Just put your name into the column "I'm intrigued!" for a proposal you like.
