# Knowledge Friday

> Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family.
> 
> â€” Kofi Annan

Every Friday we celebrate knowledge and its exchange. There are 2 modes to pursue this:

## ðŸŽ³ Barcamps 

Regularly the Knowledge Friday is a 1 hr [open space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) which gets filled spontaneously with sessions by its participants.

Typical for a barcamp, there is a lot of exchange, interaction, and dialog, with a minimum of bureaucracy or predefined content. We also strive to keep the overhead ad small as possible. _There is no audience_ is a common barcamp principle, meaning that, instead of being just consumers, in some way __all participants are contributors__!

You may come up with your own topics or also make up questions or requests towards other participants ("Hey \[name], would you like to tell us some details about \[topic]?")

### How The Open Space Works

Participants propose sessions at the beginning of the Knowledge Friday by putting up sticky notes on a whiteboard. Depending on the number of proposals, a quick voting is made and a schedule for the remaining time is created. Then, the sessions start according to the schedule.

Sessions can be work-related, but don't need to be, as long as they are of value. Session formats may be lightning talks, discussions, team work, etc. Make sure to join in on time, because the schedule is set up at the beginning. And you never know what awesome topics you might miss ðŸ˜‰

## ðŸŽ¤ Specials

__Occasionally__ we __schedule__ an event for a _special_, when somebody wants to do a session that takes more effort to gear up for. The __larger amount of preparation required__ makes it important to give speakers a fix date. Also, audience then know it is coming. Everybody is welcome to propose talks you'd give, something valuable you'd like to share, something you're keen on.

The format could be a presentation, discussion, live coding, demo, mob programming,... everything you can imagine. It's _your_ session ðŸ™‚

Never spoken before? Shy or indsecure? Consider the knowledge Friday a safe space among friends to try out yourself, practice, and grow. The audience is gentle and happy to help you out.

### Proposing a Session

To find out if a topics is intriguing, we have an open, ongoing voting. It's a way for speakers to assess the amount of interest on the topic. Also, everyone can check the list and change their votes, ask questions, etc.

Don't forget to let others know of your special. Although some standard announcements are done by KF for each new or upcoming special on our [#knowledge-friday Slack Channel](https://foobaragency.slack.com/archives/C01HR4T50TY), you're of course free to use do some extra promotion!

#### Speakers

[Create a new proposal](https://github.com/foobaragency/knowledge-friday/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=submit-a-talk.md&title=Topic). Add an excerpt/preview! It helps others to assess what it's about and if it's for them.

It doesn't need to be 60 minutes long, even lightning talks of 5-10 minutes are welcome and can be fit into a Knowledge Friday.

Pick from existing labels what matches the format you're planning.

#### Learners

[Create a new proposal](https://github.com/foobaragency/knowledge-friday/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=request-a-talk.md&title=Topic), describe what questions you would like to get answered, and what format the talk should be, e.g. presentation, discussion, live coding or coding examples.

Pick the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12255735/122565628-fe706900-d046-11eb-9710-b576e1da9676.png" height="25" /> label, and optionally others that match.
