# Knowledge Friday Specials

__Every last Friday of a month__ we have a *special* event for you! This monthly hour (+/-) of knowledge transfer can be a presentation, demo, discussion, etc. on any work-related topic.

These *Specials* (proposals, scheduled specials, and past ones) are listed in the shape of issues in our [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/foobaragency/projects/9/views/1)! Find what's upcoming, give feedback, propose your own special!

### Who's Invited?

We're in the process of opening our Knowledge Friday to participants outside our beloved agency. This will happen gradually and currently we're happily inviting special family-friends-and-fools to take part. Want to be in it, too? Reach out to us thorugh GitHub.

## How To Bring Up A Special

### What Can Be A Special?

The format could be a presentation, discussion, live coding, demo, mob programming, group testing,... everything you can imagine. It's _your_ special ðŸ™‚

Never spoken before? Shy or insecure? Consider the Knowledge Friday a safe space among friends to try out yourself, practice, and grow. The audience is gentle and happy to help you out.

### Proposing A Special

There are two reasons to create a proposal: You want to _do_ a special or you'd like to _ask for_ one.

#### Speakers

1. [Create an issue in this repo](https://github.com/foobaragency/knowledge-friday/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=submit-a-talk.md&title=Topic). 
2. Add info to help others assess what it's about and if it's for them. You'll find a template there to guide you.
3. The recommended duration is about 40 - 50 minutes with some time at the end for Q&A. If you've gt a topic you're really keen on, but that won't fit into an hour, we'll figure something out!
4. Assign yourself.
5. Pick from existing labels what characterizes the format you're planning.
6. Take the issue out of draft mode to make it visible for others.
7. Submit the new issue!
8. Add it to the [board](https://github.com/orgs/foobaragency/projects/9) column __Proposals__ either by adding it from the board view or by giving the issue the _status_ of that name. If you're unsure about the topic's viability or usefulness, or just want to discuss the proposal before perfecting it, feel free to just use the status/column __To Be Refined__.
9. Don't forget to let others know of your special. Although some standard announcements are done by KF for each new or upcoming special on our [#knowledge-friday Slack Channel](https://foobaragency.slack.com/archives/C01HR4T50TY), you're of course free to do some extra promotion!

For any advice, help with the topic, feedback on your idea, etc., reach out to Sebastian Eck ([GitHub](https://github.com/code-shambles)|[foobar Slack](https://foobaragency.slack.com/archives/D013MM65HC7)).

#### Learners

1. [Create an issue in this repo](https://github.com/foobaragency/knowledge-friday/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=request-a-talk.md&title=Topic)
2. Describe what questions you would like to get answered, and what format the talk could be, e.g. presentation, discussion, live coding or coding examples.

Pick the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12255735/122565628-fe706900-d046-11eb-9710-b576e1da9676.png" height="25" /> label, and optionally others that match.

Remember modesty and the principle of give & take. Your chances of getting a special may raise if you lead by example and do one yourself ðŸ˜‰

### Scheduling A Date

Dates are rare, but we'll find you a time slot! Sebastian ([GitHub](https://github.com/code-shambles)|[foobar Slack](https://foobaragency.slack.com/archives/D013MM65HC7)) is looking forward to work with you!
